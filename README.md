AI IN FARMING 
-------PROBLEM STATEMENT--------
Food Security is paramount importance to the growing food needs of an ever increasing population. Not having sufficient domestic production of food to meet requirement of 1.25 billion plus and still expanding will put huge burden on Indian economy. India is a large agricultural hub around the globe and majority of the total population is dependent on the agricultural sector for meeting their demand. Agriculture is the major end-user sector for fertilizers and the demand for fertilizer is growing significantly. Due to unpredictable monsoon and ever decreasing ground water and un predictable market condition and unregulated market for crop yields putting huge pressure on farmers. A solution to be developed taking into account following factors 
1. Crop Predicition Using N, P , K values and few supporting stuff
2. Pesticide Recommendation using the immage
3. Fertilizer recommendation to the crop using N, P, K Values



Based on available data from multiple sources and market condition, a solution in the form of interactive application is expected from the cream of the society to guide farmers in deciding when and which crop to grow in their fields based on geographical location of their field and market demand / trends using artificial intelligence (AI)
